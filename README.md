Usability Audit of Craigslist App:
Navigation:
Pain Point: Navigation is not intuitive. Categories are presented as plain links, which feel cluttered and disorganized. There is no clear hierarchy or filtering mechanism to narrow down the categories effectively.
Improvement Suggestion: Use a clean, icon-based navigation menu with collapsible sections and filters to make it easier for users to find what they're looking for.
Layout:
Pain Point: The interface feels text-heavy and overwhelming with minimal use of visuals or icons. There's no uniform grid or card-based layout for posts, making it difficult for users to scan through listings.
Improvement Suggestion: Introduce a modern grid or card layout for listings with thumbnail images, price, and location summaries for better scanning and comparison.
Search & Filtering:
Pain Point: The search and filtering options are basic and sometimes buried. There's a lack of real-time filters and sliders for price, distance, etc., making searching cumbersome.
Improvement Suggestion: Implement real-time, easily accessible filters, such as distance, price range, and categories, with sliders and toggles for a quicker, more dynamic experience.
Visual Design:
Pain Point: The design is very utilitarian and outdated, relying on small fonts and plain links. There is minimal use of color, typography, or icons to guide the user experience.
Improvement Suggestion: Update the design with modern fonts, spacing, icons, and a color palette that gives visual hierarchy and breathing space between sections.
Mobile Responsiveness:
Pain Point: The mobile experience feels clunky and doesn’t utilize the full screen effectively. The tap targets (buttons and links) are too small, making navigation challenging on mobile.
Improvement Suggestion: Make the app fully responsive, with larger, touch-friendly buttons and better spacing for the mobile interface.
User Interaction:
Pain Point: There’s no user-friendly way to manage listings or interactions like favorites, chat with sellers, or save searches.
Improvement Suggestion: Add user profiles with saved searches, favorite listings, and a more integrated messaging system for communication.
A more visual layout with larger images, user reviews, and a clearly defined section for details like price, location, and contact information.
